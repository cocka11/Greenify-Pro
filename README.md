### Greenify is an extension to Doze mode which was introduced on Android by Google in 2015. Doze would put a phone in a low-power state by blocking apps from waking up and would activate only for these three reasons – when the phone screen is off, disconnected from the charger and hasn’t physically moved for a while. Greenify, instead gives the user the ability to force doze inactive apps without a waiting period and tracks those apps which wake up your phone the most.
